            Constitution of India</h2>
          <p> As you might know, the Constitution of India lays down an important framework that demarcates the structure of the political system, powers, and duties of government institutions and gives the people their fundamental rights and duties towards the country. The main aim of the constitution is to protect the fundamental rights of the people. On 26 November 1949, the constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India. Although it came into effect on 26 January 1950. 

                Since the constitution was created by the constituent assembly it communicates constitutional supremacy rather than parliamentary supremacy. The Constitution of India from start to end is made by the Indians only. It replaces the Government of India Act 1935 and functions as the country’s fundamental governing document.
            
                The constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. It ensures that all the citizens of this country will get equality, liberty and justice.</p>

        <h2>Story Behind its Formation</h2>
       <p>The Constituent Assembly was formed in 1946 and consisted of members of the provincial assemblies. In total there were 299 members. The President of this Assembly was Dr Rajendra Prasad. To design the constitution a Drafting Committee was formed. Dr B. R. Ambedkar who is regarded as the ‘Father of the Constitution of India’ was the chairman of the Drafting Committee. </p>

It took the committee three years to draft the constitution, holding eleven sessions over 165 days. This is because India is a big country with so many cultures and religions. The committee wanted to make sure that they make a constitution that leads the country to success.
